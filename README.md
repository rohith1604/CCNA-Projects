Basic LAN Setup with IP Addressing and Subnetting
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the configuration of a Local Area Network (LAN) for 20 users using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed for a single department, with IP addressing and subnetting configured to ensure seamless communication. A Cisco router serves as the default gateway, and connectivity is verified using ping commands.
Objectives

Design a LAN to support 20 users.
Configure IP addressing with proper subnetting.
Set up a Cisco router as the default gateway.
Verify network connectivity using ping commands.
Document the configuration process.

Topology

Devices:
1 Cisco Router (2911)
1 Switch (2950)
20 PCs


Connections:
PCs connected to the switch using Copper Straight-Through cables.
Switch connected to the router's GigabitEthernet0/0 interface.


IP Addressing:
Network: 192.168.1.0/26 (255.255.255.192)
Router (Gateway): 192.168.1.1
PCs: 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.21
Switch (VLAN 1, for management): 192.168.1.22
Usable IP Range: 192.168.1.1â€“192.168.1.62
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.63



Prerequisites

Cisco Packet Tracer: Version 7.3 or later recommended.
Basic Knowledge: Understanding of IP addressing, subnetting, and Cisco IOS commands.

Setup Instructions
Step 1: Download the Project

Clone this repository or download the .pkt file:git clone <repository-url>


Open the Basic_LAN_Setup.pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Step 2: Network Topology

Add Devices:
Place 20 PCs (PC0 to PC19), 1 Switch (2950), and 1 Router (2911) in the Packet Tracer workspace.


Connect Devices:
Connect each PC's FastEthernet0 to the switch's FastEthernet0/1 to FastEthernet0/20 using Copper Straight-Through cables.
Connect Switch0 FastEthernet0/24 to Router0 GigabitEthernet0/0 using a Copper Straight-Through cable.



Step 3: Configure IP Addressing

PCs:
For each PC (PC0 to PC19):
Go to Desktop > IP Configuration.
Assign:
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.2 (increment for each PC, up to 192.168.1.21)
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1






Router:
Access Router0's CLI:enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192
no shutdown
exit
write memory




Switch (Optional, for Management):
Access Switch0's CLI:enable
configure terminal
interface vlan 1
ip address 192.168.1.22 255.255.255.192
no shutdown
exit
ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
write memory





Step 4: Verify Connectivity

Ping Tests:
From PC0's Command Prompt, ping another PC (e.g., PC1):ping 192.168.1.3


Ping the default gateway:ping 192.168.1.1


Repeat from other PCs to confirm connectivity.


Simulation Mode:
Switch to Simulation mode in Packet Tracer.
Send a Simple PDU from PC0 to PC19 to visualize packet flow.
Verify successful packet delivery.

Save the .pkt file and include it in the repository.


Running the Project

Open Basic_LAN_Setup.pkt in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Verify configurations as per the setup instructions.
Run ping tests to confirm connectivity.
Use Simulation mode to observe packet flow if needed.

Troubleshooting

Ping Fails:
Check IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways on PCs.
Ensure Router0's GigabitEthernet0/0 is active (no shutdown).
Verify cable types (use Copper Straight-Through).


Simulation Issues:
Ensure all devices are powered on and interfaces are up.
Check for correct IP assignments.
